slither contracts/WEB3Staking.sol --solc-remaps '@openzeppelin=node_modules/@openzeppelin' --exclude naming-convention,external-function,low-level-calls

ToDo for version 1.1:
1. Add logic to unstake initial stake when contract has no reward. And user is allowed to claim remains reward after unstaking
2. Add historicalTotalStaked variable (contract limit logic will use that one) and rename totalStaked to currentTotalStaked
3. Set APR_DIVIDER constant to 10000 instead of 1000
